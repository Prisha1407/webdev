        <h3>Line Following Robot</h3>
        <p>It is an autonomous bot which follows a predefined line. Based on inputs from the sensors used, the robot makes decisions about how to adjust its direction and speed to stay on the line.The major components used were the IR sensors, good grip tyres, 100 rpm bo motors, sun board for chassis and Arduino uno</p>

        <h4>Bluetooth Controlled RC Car</h4>
        <p>This Bluetooth RC car operates by integrating Arduino, Motors, and Bluetooth module. The Arduino serves as the brain of the car, interpreting signals received via Bluetooth. The Bluetooth module facilitates wireless communication with a paired device, mobile phone in this case. The car can be controlled through an existing smartphone application and through serial monitor too that sends commands, such as forward, backward, left, and right to the Arduino.</p>
